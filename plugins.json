What you need to pay attention to is the ports of the mirror server and rcon related information in order to avoid encountering to the main server\n\nIt's not essential for a mirror server to be a MCDR server, you can use the vanilla or something else.\n\n## Config\n\nIf you want to change the config of this plugin, you can change the content of `MirrorServerReforged.json` in `config` folder\n\n```json\n{\n  \"world\":[\n    \"world\"\n  ],\n  \"command\":\"python3 -m mcdreforged\",\n  \"rcon\":{\n    \"enable\":false,\n    \"host\":\"localhost\",\n    \"port\":25565,\n    \"password\":\"password\"\n  },\n  \"source\": \"./server\",\n  \"target': './Mirror/server\"\n}\n```\n\nNow, I'll introduce the content of the config file:\n- `world` is a list include all your world's folders. For `Vanilla` type server, this can leave it as default. But for `Bukkit`/`Waterfall`/`Catserver` or other server cores like them that have more than one world folder, you need to input them in the list follow after `world`. E.G.: The `Bukkit` server has folders `world`, `world_nether`, `world_the_end`, then it should be filled with `['world','world_nether','world_the_end']`.\n- `command` Start command. Here we use this command as you use MCDR in your mirror server as default. For `Vanilla` or `Bukkit-Like` server, you need to change it to the suitable one. E.G.: `java -Xmx16G -Xms1G -jar server.jar nogui`\n- `rcon` will contain all the rcon-related config and this feature will only be used to turn off the mirror server remotely.\n    - `enable` is the switch of rcon feature, it should be `true` or `false`. Rcon will not be able to use if this is set to `false`, especially the command `!!msr stop`\n    - `host` is the address of your mirror server, change it as your need.\n    - `port` is the port of your mirror server, change it as your need.\n    - `password` is the password of the rcon feature on your mirror server, change it as your need.\n- `source` is the save folder of you main server save.\n- `target` is the save folder of your mirror server save.\n\n## Command List\n\n```\n!!msr help - Display help message\n!!msr sync - Sync the world to the mirror server\n!!msr reload - Reload config\n!!msr start - Start mirror server\n!!msr stop - Stop mirror server (Rcon feature enable is needed)\n!!msr init -

`enable`是rcon功能的总开关，表示您是否要启用本插件的rcon来进行远程服务器的关闭，参考值为`true`和`false`，当设定为`false`时，`!!msr stop`命令将不可用\n    - `host`是rcon功能的宿服务器地址，根据自身需求填写即可\n    - `port`是rcon功能的宿服务器端口，根据自身需求填写即可\n    - `password`是rcon功能的宿服务器的密码，根据自身需求填写即可\n- `source`是你的主服务器的存档位置\n- `target`是你镜像服的存档位置\n\n## 命令列表\n\n```\n!!msr help -
