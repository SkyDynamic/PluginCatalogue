# MirrorServerReforged

![MirrorServerReforged](https://socialify.git.ci/EMUnion/MirrorServerReforged/image?description=1&font=Inter&forks=1&issues=1&language=1&owner=1&pattern=Circuit%20Board&stargazers=1&theme=Light)

A reforged version of [MCDR-Mirror-Server](https://github.com/GamerNoTitle/MCDR-Mirror-Server), which is a plugin for MCDR-Reforged 2.0+.

I'll simply introduce it.

## Getting Started

This plugin will initalize when the first run, it will do the following opeartions (the path can be changed in the config)
- Create `MirrorServerReforged.json` in your `config` folder and fill the default config in it
- Create`Mirror` folder to store your files of mirror server
- Create `./server/world/`/`./world` in `Mirror` folder (This depends on whether you use MCDR or not, use as default)

But these operations are not enough, what you need to do are as following (the path can be changed in the config)
- Put your server core and dependencies into `./Mirror/server` folder
- Edit start command and rcon information in file `config.yml` in the folder`./Mirror/`
- Edit the content in `./Mirror/server/server.properties`. What you need to pay attention to is the ports of the mirror server and rcon related information in order to avoid encountering to the main server

It's not essential for a mirror server to be a MCDR server, you can use the vanilla or something else.

## Config

If you want to change the config of this plugin, you can change the content of `MirrorServerReforged.json` in `config` folder

```json
{
  "world":[
    "world"
  ],
  "command":"python3 -m mcdreforged",
  "rcon":{
    "enable":false,
    "host":"localhost",
    "port":25565,
    "password":"password"
  },
  "source": "./server",
  "target': './Mirror/server"
}
```

Now, I'll introduce the content of the config file:
- `world` is a list include all your world's folders. For `Vanilla` type server, this can leave it as default. But for `Bukkit`/`Waterfall`/`Catserver` or other server cores like them that have more than one world folder, you need to input them in the list follow after `world`. E.G.: The `Bukkit` server has folders `world`, `world_nether`, `world_the_end`, then it should be filled with `['world','world_nether','world_the_end']`.
- `command` Start command. Here we use this command as you use MCDR in your mirror server as default. For `Vanilla` or `Bukkit-Like` server, you need to change it to the suitable one. E.G.: `java -Xmx16G -Xms1G -jar server.jar nogui`
- `rcon` will contain all the rcon-related config and this feature will only be used to turn off the mirror server remotely.
    - `enable` is the switch of rcon feature, it should be `true` or `false`. Rcon will not be able to use if this is set to `false`, especially the command `!!msr stop`
    - `host` is the address of your mirror server, change it as your need.
    - `port` is the port of your mirror server, change it as your need.
    - `password` is the password of the rcon feature on your mirror server, change it as your need.
- `source` is the save folder of you main server save.
- `target` is the save folder of your mirror server save.

## Command List

```
!!msr help - Display help message
!!msr sync - Sync the world to the mirror server
!!msr reload - Reload config
!!msr start - Start mirror server
!!msr stop - Stop mirror server (Rcon feature enable is needed)
!!msr init - Initalize mirror server (Use it only when you use MCDR in your mirror server)
!!msr status - Checkout the status of your mirror server
```

## Description
Send some private message to others at same time in easier way.<br>
Use triggers (default<strong>'**'</strong>) to send private messages to everyone the player specifies.
## How to use
1. Use `!!whisper <player>` command add player(s) can receive private message
2. Prepare a writable_book and rename it to "MCDRwhisper" and place it in the hotbar
3. Write your whispered words in writable_book~, be careful not to break lines
4. Then enter the default trigger ** in the chat bar
5. They should be able to hear from you~
6. Before whispering the next time, remember to empty the contents of the writable_book ~~（I originally wanted to clear it automatically, but I won't use /data command）~~
7. Just that, you can avoid using commands such as /tell to send messages to different people one by one
## Attention
- The message to be sent needs to be written in a writable_book called <strong>"MCDRwhisper"</strong> in the hotbar
- Make sure there is no <strong>LINE BREAKS</strong> in the message to be sent
- Before whispering the next time, remember to <strong>EMPTY</strong> the contents of the writable_book
